
A radicular cyst is impossible to diagnose with certainty without histological investigation. 

    However, teeth with a possible radicular cyst always also have another endodontic 

    diagnosis: apical periodontitis. That is why, from a clinical point of view, 

    such a lesion is usually not a problem even though the final diagnosis of 

    a radicular cyst may be established only after the treatment.
It is often assumed that large, roundish lesions that meet the root surface 

    at a right angle are, with high probability, radicular cysts, but this is 

    not supported by combined histological-radiographic studies. There is evidence 

    suggesting that at least a certain type of radicular cyst (true radicular 

    cyst) usually requires periapical surgery for healing in addition to conservative 

    endodontic therapy (see 'Etiology of radicular cyst' in book 5).
