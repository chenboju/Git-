Background: One of the signi?cant problems of Partial root canal therapy is periapical cyst and granuloma. Microorganisms contribute to the creation of periapical lesions, causing chronic illness and dental granuloma. This study aims to determine the e?ect of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) on the exacerbation of the disease using the PCR technique.
Methods: Para?n tissue samples containing 25 periapical cysts, and 25 dental granulomas underwent DNA extraction. The extracted DNA quality was con?rmed by the £]-globin component replication using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Moreover, the samples were evaluated using the nested-PCR technique in terms of the frequency of EBV using dedicated primers. The data analysis was performed using chi-squared, Fischer, and independent t-tests.
Results: EBV was detected in 4% (1/25) of the periapical sample and 4% (1/25) of the 25 dental granuloma samples. Despite the above observations, there was no statistically signi?cant di?erence in the frequency of EBV between the periapical cyst and dental granuloma samples.
Conclusion: Based on the results of the study, EBV is likely to a?ect the pathogenesis or the growth of periapical lesions. Given that there is not a lot of research in this area and the results of the studies are con?icting, the ?ndings attract more research.





1. Introduction

   Dental granuloma is a relatively common lesion consisting of the proliferating mass of granulation tissue with bacterial nature, which is generated in response to the dead tissue in the tooth canal section. This in?ammatory process is a reaction to chronic stimulation caused by the damaged root canal system (Deyhimi and Aminzadeh, 2008). However, not all dental granulomas lead necessarily to the creation of a periapical cyst (Cohen, 2009). The periapical (radicular) cyst is the most prevalent type of mandibular odontogenic cyst in the world, accounting for about 50¡V75% of oral cysts (Lin et al., 2017; Shetty et al., 2010). Due to in- ?ammatory pathogenesis, this cyst can be found in all age groups; however, it is usually observed between the third and ?fth decade (30¡V49 years), and in many cases in the fourth and ?fth and even the sixth decade (40¡V59 years) (Lin et al., 2017). The periapical cyst is re- portedly more common in males than females (Deyhimi, 2006). In- ?ammatory cells may have latent herpes viruses (Popovic et al., 2015). The interaction between herpes viruses and acute in?ammation is

mutual. Active viral infection causes acute periapical in?ammation and in?ammatory intermediates, which can activate periapical herpes virus (Sabeti et al., 2003). The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in 1964 by Epstein and Barr (Tayebi et al., 2006). EBV belongs to the herpes- viruses family, and one of the eight known human viruses belonging to the herpes family that infects a signi?cant percentage (> 90%) of the population worldwide and is the causative agent of infectious mono- nucleosis (Rostamzadeh et al., 2007; K?ppers, 2003). It is the most prevalent and stable cancer-related virus, which was ?rst discovered in the cells separated from African Burkitt's lymphoma (Cohen, 2009). It is detected frequently in Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and T- cell lymphoma (Sin and Dittmer, 2012). The di?culties in the infection of primary epithelial cells indicate that EBV is essential in natural complex multi-dimensional epithelial malignancies (Tayebi et al., 2006; Makino et al., 2015). Epstein-Bar virus can be hidden secreted in epi- thelial cells and oral tissue. Studying periapical lesions is essential for EBV, as the virus can be important in immune-response reactions (Chen et al., 2009).

   Immunohistochemical and immunohistological diagnostic methods can be used to identify the EBV-related tumors (Hess, 2004; Mowry et al., 2008). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an appropriate method for a small number of EBV variants. PCR technique is often used for the identi?cation of EBV in random samples collected from transplant pa- tients and blood samples taken from patients with infectious mono- nucleosis (Telenti et al., 1990).
   Since microorganisms may have contribution to the pathogenesis or progression of periapical lesion and, to the best knowledge of the re- searchers, very few studies have been conducted in this ?eld so far, this study aimed at evaluating the presence of EBV applying the PCR technique.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sample collection

   Fifty para?n blocks with clinical and histopathological diagnosis of periapical cyst (n = 25) and dental granuloma (n = 25) were gathered from archive of oral pathology laboratory, dental school, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, Iran, which belongs to the 2010¡V2017 period were collected and investigated in this study.

2.2. DNA extraction

   Ten sections (10 £gm) of the para?n blocks were cut and placed in a 5 mL Eppendorf tube. The ?rst phase of depara?nization was carried out by initially adding 800 mL of Xylene into the above tubes. After turning the tubes on the shaker and incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the tubes were centrifuged at a 14,000 rpm speed for 10 min at 18 ¢XC. The steps 2 and 4 mentioned above were again per- formed with new Xylene, then incubated for 10 min at 37 ¢XC. In the next step, the surface materials were removed, and 800 mL of ethanol was added to the tubes and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. Finally, the centrifuge and the surface materials were discarded and processed for 15 min at room temperature for the evaporation of alco- hols. In this stage, DNA extraction was performed by Gene All kit concerning the manufacturer's instruction. The extracted DNA was stored at ?20 ¢XC until it was used.

2.3. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

   First, all extracted DNA samples were analyzed by spectro- photometer and NanoDrop in terms of concentration and DNA purity. Then, PCR was carried out with dedicated PCO4/PCO3 primers (£]-

globin) (Table 2) to con?rm the quality of the extracted DNA (Mahmoudvand et al., 2015).
   PCR reactions were carried out for each isolate in the ?nal volume of 25 £gl containing about 50 ng (5 mL) of the extracted DNA with 2.5 £gl of Bu?er 1¡Ñ (CinnaGene, Iran), 1 £gl of MgCl2 (CinnaGen, Iran), 0.5 £gl of dNTP (CinnaGene, Iran), 0.2 £gl of Taq DNA Polymerase (Taq DNA Polymerase), and 1 £gl of each dedicated primer (PCO3 and PCO4) (Mahmoudvand et al., 2015).
   PCR experiments for £]-globin were performed as follows: The initial denaturation was carried out for 10 min at 94 ¢XC, followed by 35 cycles at 94 ¢XC for 45 s of denaturation. Annealing was done at 72 ¢XC for 45 s. Then, the extension was performed for 1 min at 72 ¢XC, and the ?nal extension was performed for 10 min at 72 ¢XC.
   Nested-PCR experiments were performed to identify EBV from the DNA extracted from the para?n blocks in two stages: The ?rst stage consists of the DNA combination extracted from the para?n blocks and Blend Master Mix A (Kianmed, Iran). The second stage includes of the output of the early stage together with Blend Master Mix B with dedi- cated primers and the initial denaturation temperature program for 5 min at 95 ¢XC, 40 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 ¢XC, cooling for 30 s at 72 ¢XC, extension for 30 s at 72 ¢XC. The ?nal format was performed for 5 min at 72 ¢XC (Table 2).
   The PCR results were then loaded on the 2% agarose gel and were observed using the UV device (BIO-RAD, the USA) (Fig. 1).

3. Results

   Out of the 50 samples studied, 25 were male, and 25 were female. This study aimed to determine the presence of EBV in periapical and dental granuloma cysts. The age range of the subjects in the group of periapical cyst was between 12 and 50 years with the mean age of
34.1 ¡Ó 10.1 years, and the age range of dental granuloma was between
13 and 55 years with the mean age of 36.3 ¡Ó 10.6 years. The in- dependent t-test showed that there was no signi?cant di?erence be- tween the two groups (p = 0.46).
   In the periapical cyst group, 13 (52%) were male, and 12 (48%) were female. In the dental granuloma group, 12 (48%) were male 13 (52%) were female. Chi-square test showed that there was no sig- ni?cant di?erence in the frequency distribution of gender of individuals investigated between the two groups (p = 0.78).
   One sample (4%) of periapical cysts and one sample (4%) of peri- apical granuloma were reported positive in terms of the presence of EBV (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Fisher's exact test showed that there was no signi?cant correlation between the two groups in terms of the fre- quency of EBV presence (p= 1). Given the positive sample was

associated with a 35-year-old male in the periapical group, and a 33- year-old female in the periapical granuloma group, it was not possible to study its relevance to age and gender considering the low frequency of EBV.


4. Discussion

   The periapical lesion is an in?ammatory immune disease a?ecting periapical dental tissue and its surrounding bones. These processes are initially established by multi-microbial bacterial infection from the root canal (Yildirim et al., 2006). Microbial infection in the root canal of the tooth is necessary to form a periapical lesion. However, no signs of periapical in?ammatory lesions have been observed in Germ-free (GF) animals (Andric et al., 2007). EBV infection is often associated with di?erent types of oral diseases (Satija and Rai, 2015). Researchers stated that EBV plays a key role in the inception of the periapical in- ?ammatory process and possibly in its development through cell da- mage (Makino et al., 2015).
   In the present study, 4% of EBV periapical lesions were observed, which is much lower compared with similar studies, such as Makino et al. (2015) (75%). In addition, the results of this study are consistent with the ?ndings of Yazdi et al.'s (2008) study in which the presence of EBV in 6% of apical periodontitis was explored using the PCR tech- nique. In addition, in their research on the presence of EBV in 6% of apical periodontitis using PCR technique, Yazdi et al. (2008) reported that they are consistent with the ?ndings of the present study. Re- searchers believe that the possibility of diagnosing EBV using the PCR technique in the acute phase of the disease (i.e., symptomatic phase of the disease) is more applicable (Jakovljevic et al., 2015). In their study, Sabeti et al. (2003) speci?ed that it is impossible to diagnose EBV in periapical lesions without symptoms (e.g. pain, swelling, and secretion) while the presence of EBV was diagnosed in 88% of symptomatic periapical lesions. Moreover, in the study of Hern?di et al. (2013), EBV was reported as the predominant pathogen. They reported the si- multaneous presence of HCMV infection and EBV infection in periapical lesions while the presence of the EBV genome was not reported in any asymptomatic lesions. Based on a study conducted via the PCR tech- nique, Slots et al. (2004) stated that HCMV was observed in 37% of symptomatic and asymptomatic specimens, whereas EBV was present only in HCMV-infected lesions.
Thus, the result showed the role of other viruses in the activation of
EBV in periapical lesions. Besides, given the low amount of EBV and HCMV in the studies of Dawson III et al. (2009) and Nibali et al. (2009) performed using the RT-PCR method, they stated that the absence of an active viral infection might cause a decrease in the amount of virus in the samples studied. Sunde et al. (2008) also reported that the presence of EBV was 45% via the RT-PCR technique; however, HCMV presence

was observed in none of the periapical periodontitis samples. This dif- ference stems from host factors, environmental factors such as genetic background, ethnicity, economic status, DNA extraction method, as well as PCR application methods. In their study, Yildirim et al. (2006) proposed that the frequency of EBV is related to the amount of bone damage and the resulting cytokines, so there will be more viruses in larger lesions. In another study, Hern?di et al. (2010) reported the presence of EBV in large-scale periapical lesions (5 mm) compared to the small lesions with the rate of di?erence (i.e., 50%). In addition to detecting the presence of EBV and HCMV in periapical granulomatous tissues by RT-PCR, Sabeti et al. (2003) suggested that the prevalence of herpes simplex viruses was higher in symptomatic periapical lesions compared to asymptomatic periapical lesions. Therefore, the result con?rms the role of the size of lesions in virus positivity and multi- plicity. In their study, Andric et al. (2007) also reported that in some studies, EBV could be false-positive responses due to tissue infection examined to the patient's saliva. However, the present study showed that the presence of the virus was not signi?cantly di?erent between the two groups (P > 0.05). The results of this study are consistent with the studies of Saboia-Dantas et al. (2007), Li et al. (2009), Jakovljevic et al. (2015). In their research, Kabak et al. (2005) proposed that de- spite the presence of HSV virus in periapical cyst and not in dental granuloma, the ?ndings of the study are consistent with the present study. The limitations of our study include the following: Firstly,

5. Conclusion

   According to the results of the present study, it was not precisely revealed whether or not EBV has a role in pathogenesis or progression of periapical lesions. Hence, further studies with large sample sizes are required.
