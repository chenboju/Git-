ORAL MANIFESTATIONS OF WILLIAMS-BEUREN SYNDROME. SHIRLENE BARBOSA PIMENTEL FERREIRA, MELISSA MACHADO VIANA, NAIARA GON?ALVES FONSECA MAIA, LET?CIA LIMA LE?O, RENATO ASSIS MACHADO, MARCOS JOS? BURLE DE AGUIAR, HERC?LIO MARTELLI J?NIOR.
ก@ก@Objectives: To investigate and describe the oral features in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS).
ก@ก@Methods: Seventeen patients diagnosed with WBS were ex- amined. In all the cases, WBS was determined based on molecular diagnosis. All the patients underwent clinical evaluation, which in- cluded general and oral examinations, and radiographic evaluation. Results: The mean age of the patients was 14 years and 6 months (ranging from 2 to 36 years). Eleven patients were female. Oroscopy exams revealed malocclusion in 16 patients (94.12%). Eleven patients (64.7%) exhibited dental midline deviation, and
9 patients (52.9%) had a high-arched palate. Mandibular retrognathism was found in 6 patients (35.3%) and the dental arches had an irregular alignment in 3 (17.6%) patients. Two patients (11.8%) exhibited tooth crowding and 3 (17.6%) exhibited exces- sive interdental spacing. Microdontia was observed in 3 patients (17.6%), and radiographic examination detected agenesis in 3 pa- tients (17.6%).
ก@ก@Conclusions: Patients with WBS can have important oral ab- normalities. The present findings of oral alterations in WBS contribute to knowledge regarding manifestations of the disease. Early detection and treatment of the oral alterations in individu- als with the disease can provide appropriate support and improve the quality of life of these patients.

THE ROLE OF GALECTIN-7 IN ENDOTHELIAL CELLS OF PERIAPICAL GRANULOMAS, RADICULAR CYSTS, AND RESIDUAL RADICULAR CYSTS. LIVIA NATALIA SALES BRITO, ARLLEY DE SOUSA LEIT?O, L?LIA BATISTA DE SOUZA, ?RICKA JANINE DANTAS DA SILVEIRA, POLLIANNA MUNIZ ALVES, CASSIANO FRANCISCO WEEGE NONAKA, GUSTAVO PINA GODOY.
ก@ก@Objectives: Our aims were to assess the immunoexpression of galectin-7 in endothelial cells in periapical granulomas (PGs), radicular cysts (RCs), and residual radicular cysts (RRCs), and to correlate these with the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate and thickness of the cystic epithelial lining.
ก@ก@Study Design: Twenty PGs, 20 RCs, and 20 RRCs were sub- jected to immunohistochemical analysis using the anti-galectin-7 antibody. The immunoexpression of this lectin was assessed by es- timating the percentage of immunopositive vessels in the connective tissue of PGs and in the cystic capsule of RCs and RRCs.
ก@ก@Results: The PGs and RCs showed higher endothelial cell ex- pression of galectin-7 than the RRCs (P < .05). Lesions presenting inflammatory infiltrate grade III revealed the highest endothelial immunoexpression of galectin-7 (P < .05). RCs and RRCs with hy- perplastic epithelium showed higher expression of galectin-7 when compared to atrophic epithelial lesions (P = .041). There was a pos- itive correlation between the immunoexpression of galectin-7 and the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate (r = 0.587; P < .001).
ก@ก@
Conclusion: It is suggested that the main function of galectin-7 in GP, CR, and CRR endothelial cells is related to amplification of the inflammatory response.


RADIATION-RELATED SUPERFICIAL ORAL MUCOCELES: AN UNDER-RECOGNIZED ACUTE TOXICITY IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS. ANA CAROLINA PRADO RIBEIRO, ALAN ROGER SANTOS-SILVA, KARINA MORAIS- FARIA, WAGNER GOMES DA SILVA, THA?S BIANCA BRAND?O.
ก@ก@Objective: To describe an original case series of head and neck cancer patients who developed superficial oral mucoceles (SOMs) during radiotherapy.
ก@ก@Study Design: A cross-sectional retrospective study was per- formed with head and neck cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy from 2013 to 2016.
ก@ก@Results: Ten (1.2%) patients developed SOMs during radio- therapy; most (80%) of these were men with a mean age of 59.5 years at diagnosis. SOMs mainly affected the floor of the mouth (60%) between the fourth and the sixth weeks of radiation therapy. All the lesions were asymptomatic and spontaneously ruptured ap- proximately 8 days after diagnosis.
ก@ก@Conclusions: Although rare, SOMs may be regarded as an acute oral toxicity of head and neck radiotherapy.


PREVALENCE OF HYPERTELORISM IN NONSYNDROMIC CLEFT LIP AND/OR PALATE. C?LIA M?RCIA FERNANDES MAIA, LUCIANO S?LIA NASSER, DANIELLA REIS BARBOSA MARTELLI, MARIO S?RGIO OLIVEIRA SWERTS, JO?O VITOR QUADROS TONELLI, RENATO ASSIS MACHADO, HERC?LIO MARTELLI J?NIOR.
ก@ก@Objective: To investigate the presence of hypertelorism in pa- tients with nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P).
ก@ก@Methods: This cross-sectional, observational, case-control study included 356 patients. The distances between the outer and inner corners of the eyes of patients with NSCL/P and controls were mea- sured with a rigid millimeter ruler in the primary position.
Subsequently, the canthal index (C = internal canthal/external canthal กั 100) was calculated. A hypertelorism diagnosis was ren- dered with a value greater than or equal to 48. The information
collected was stored in a database and analyzed using the statis- tical program SPSS? version 20.0. Of the 356 patients analyzed, 150 (42.1%) were from the case group and 206 (57.9%) from the control group. Among the 150 cases, 57.3% were of cleft lip and palate (CLP), 26% cleft lip (CL), and 16.7% cleft palate (CP). The mean canthal index for the case group was 33.6 and for the control group was 40.18. The mean canthal index was 34.07 for patients with CLP, 32.89 for CL, and 31.84 for CP.
ก@ก@Conclusion: This study did not identify the presence of hypertelorism in patients with NSCL/P. Future studies with larger populations will be required to better identify this relationship.
