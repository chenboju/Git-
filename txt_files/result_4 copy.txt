Definition / general
Inflammatory type odontogenic cyst associated with the root of a nonviable (necrotic) tooth (
)
Lined by nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, derived from rests of Malassez
Essential features
Located in the maxilla or mandible (
)
Must involve the root of a nonviable (necrotic) tooth
Cystic strips of nondysplastic (para)keratinizing squamous epithelium
Background stromal inflammation
Terminology
Generally synonymous terms: radicular cyst, apical cyst, periapical cyst
Radicular cyst: present in association with any portion of the tooth root
Periapical cyst: present at the tooth root apex
Lateral radicular cyst: present at the opening of lateral accessory root canals
Residual cyst: radicular (periapical) cyst that persists after extraction of offending tooth (
)
Dental implant associated cyst: likely best viewed as a subtype of residual cyst (
)
ICD coding
ICD-11:
- radicular cyst
Epidemiology
Most common jaw cyst (
)
Accounts for ~60% of all odontogenic cysts
Most common in fourth and fifth decades but occurs over a wide age range
Sites
Radicular cyst is associated with the root of a nonviable (necrotic) tooth within the maxilla or mandible
Most common location: anterior maxilla
Second most common location: posterior mandible (
,
)
Pathophysiology
Inflammation (usually associated with dental caries extending into the dental pulp or trauma) stimulates cells in the rests of Malassez
Epithelial cells proliferate to form a cystic cavity
Cystic cavity can enlarge secondary to
Osmotic pressure
Secondary infection and inflammation related to foreign material or bacteria
Ongoing inflammation and proinflammatory cytokines (
)
Etiology
Radicular (periapical) cyst is caused by inflammation at the apex of a nonviable (necrotic) tooth root (WHO)
Clinical features
May be asymptomatic and incidentally discovered on radiographs taken for another purpose
May have recent or remote history of tooth pain (WHO)
Symptoms of pain and drainage if secondarily infected
May be associated with
formation
Reference:
Diagnosis
Lesion is intraosseous within the maxilla or mandible
Lesion is associated with necrotic tooth root (radiographically or grossly)
Histopathology is stratified squamous epithelium (nonspecific but in the context of the above parameters is compatible with radicular cyst)
Radiology description
Panoramic (panorex) radiograph, intraoral film or cross sectional imaging may be useful depending on cyst location, lesion size and the need to evaluate additional parameters (
)
Radiology is essential to identify landmarks and the extent of disease in the preoperative and follow up setting
Round to oval radiolucency associated with the root of a nonviable (necrotic) tooth
Can resorb or remodel the root of the tooth

Prognostic factors
Overall prognosis is excellent once lesion is treated
Recurrence rate low
Case reports
19 year old woman with bilateral radicular cysts (
)
47 year old woman with radicular cyst mimicking a nasopalatine duct cyst (
)
49 year old woman with persistent pain in the left mandibular angle with limitations in mouth opening (
)
Treatment
Varies with age of patient, access to care and state or prognosis of the tooth
In some patients, necrotic tooth pulp can be treated via root canal with the goal of inducing cyst involution (
)
In some patients with very large cysts or cysts that fail to involute after the above treatment, surgical management is likely required to treat the intraosseous cyst (
)
Any surgically removed material is submitted for pathologic examination (

Lateral mandibular lesion
Gross description
Surgical specimens usually consist of multiple, irregular tissue fragments
Possible minute bone fragments
All (nontooth) tissue should be submitted for histologic examination to definitively confirm the diagnosis
Associated tooth received as specimen can be described grossly and supplemented with photographs where equipment is available
Frozen section description
Multilayered stratified squamous epithelial lining
Background fibrous and granulation tissue with acute or chronic inflammation
Associated mineralized tissues (bone, tooth) may be present but technically difficult to section
May have associated bacterial colonies present

Overview of cyst appearances
Nonkeratinized epithelium
Acute inflammation
Bacterial colonies
Microscopic (histologic) description
Epithelial lining
Lined by nonkeratinizing stratified squamous epithelium of variable thickness
Architecturally creates an arcading pattern
Can have limited areas of keratinization, goblet cells or scattered ciliated cells
Rushton hyaline bodies can occur within the epithelium (not necessary for diagnosis, not specific to radicular cyst) (
)
Fibrous capsule
Varying thickness with acute or chronic inflammatory cells
Plasma cells may be particularly prominent
Foamy histiocytes may also be present
Additional features possible (

Cholesterol clefts
Pulse granuloma
Bacterial colonies
Foreign material related to prior dental treatments
Portions of bone, tooth or tooth root
Regional odontogenic rests and neural tissue may be incorporated into biopsy tissue sample material by virtue of the curettage procedure

Sample pathology report
Left mandible, biopsy:
Intraosseous stratified squamous epithelial lined cyst, consistent with radicular cyst
Differential diagnosis
:
Elongated clefts (spaces) in tissue remaining after cholesterol crystals dissolved in processing
Clefts are associated with an adjacent or surrounding foreign body type giant cell reaction
Rich granulation type inflammatory infiltrate, including hemosiderin laden macrophages
:
Polypoid chronic inflammation and granulation tissue only
Lacking keratinizing squamous epithelial proliferation
Lacking anucleate squames
Microscopically some cases may be identical to cholesteatoma, though if middle ear is preserved, no middle ear mucosa will be seen microscopically
(inflamed):
Uniform epithelial lining 6 - 8 cells thick; lacks rete ridges
May have artifactual clefting between epithelium and underlying fibroconnective tissue
Epithelium characterized by palisaded hyperchromatic basal cell layer comprised of cuboidal to columnar cells
May have areas of budding growth from the basal cells
Luminal surface has wavy (corrugated) parakeratotic epithelial cells
Lumen may contain keratinaceous debris
:
Lack of epithelial cell maturation or polarity, atypical mitosis, pleomorphism, dyskeratosis or individual cell keratinization

Board review style question #1
Which nonhistologic feature is essential to support the diagnosis of radicular cyst?
Association with impacted tooth
Association with nonviable (necrotic) tooth
Bilateral presentation in maxilla
Localized to the oral tongue
Board review style answer #1
B.
Association with nonviable (necrotic) tooth. Radicular cyst is seen in association with a nonviable (necrotic) tooth. Answer A is incorrect because association with an impacted tooth is a required element for dentigerous cyst.  Answer C is incorrect because radicular cyst uncommonly occurs as a bilateral lesion. Answer D is incorrect because radicular cyst is located in association with teeth, within bone.
Reference:
Board review style question #2
Which of the following sites is most commonly involved by radicular cyst?
Anterior mandible
Anterior maxilla
Maxillary sinus
Posterior mandible
Board review style answer #2
B.
Anterior maxilla. Anterior maxilla is the most common site of involvement for radicular cyst. Answer A is incorrect because radicular cyst can involve the anterior mandible but is not the most common location. Answer C is incorrect because radicular cyst is unlikely to be centered in the maxillary sinus, unless the lesion secondarily extends into the sinus, which is uncommon. Answer D is incorrect because the posterior mandible is the second most common site for radicular cyst to occur.
