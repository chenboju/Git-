Wisdom teeth, or third molars, generally erupt between the ages of 17 and 26 years (Venta 1999; Kruger 2001). More than other teeth, wisdom teeth can fail to erupt or can erupt only partially, with a worldwide impaction prevalence of 24% (Carter 2015). Impaction occurs when complete eruption into a normal functional position is prevented and completion of root growth is fully established. This can be due to lack of space (in the mouth), obstruction by another tooth or development in an abnormal position (Venta 1999). A tooth that is completely impacted can be entirely covered by soft tissue,"}

Evidence from these cross-sectional studies is very unreliable, and studies assessing the outcomes of retained wisdom teeth are rare because of problems associated with a complex long-term prospective study design (Van der Sanden 2002). Actuarial lifetime tables have shed some light on the natural history of asymptomatic impacted lower wisdom teeth, but longer follow-up periods are required (Fernandes 2010)."}
